Ideas to reduce suffering: 1. We could provide the men with food and water so they wouldn't be hungry or thirsty.
2. We could offer them a place to stay for the night so they would be warm and safe.
3. We could give them a chess set of their own so they wouldn't have to play in the dark.
4. We could give them a light so they could see the chess board and their pieces.
5. We could listen to their conversations and offer them help or advice with their game.
